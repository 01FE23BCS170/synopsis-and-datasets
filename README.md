ðŸ«€ Risk Prediction Model for Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)
ðŸ“Œ Synopsis

Not all patients with visible coronary plaques go on to develop major cardiac events. The risk of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) depends on a combination of plaque morphology, vessel narrowing (stenosis), and patient-specific clinical factors (age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking history, etc.).

This project aims to develop a predictive model that integrates imaging-derived features and clinical data to stratify patient risk (Low, Moderate, High) for MACE. Accurate prediction can help in personalized treatment planning and preventive cardiology.

Key Objectives:

Extract plaque features (type, volume, stenosis).

Combine with clinical risk factors (age, BP, cholesterol, diabetes, etc.).

Train interpretable ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluate models using AUC-ROC and explain predictions using SHAP/LIME.

Deploy an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) for clinicians.

ðŸ“‚ Datasets
1. Primary Research Dataset

MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis)

Source: BioLINCC â€“ MESA

Multimodal: Clinical + Imaging (CT, MRI, plaque burden, calcium scoring, stenosis).
